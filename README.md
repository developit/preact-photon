A little wrapper around [photon] to make it cake to use via [preact] _(or React `*`)_.

This requires that you already have the [photon] CSS included in your app.

## What does it look like?

Well, this: **[Preact + Photon = <3](http://codepen.io/developit/pen/ZbajXQ?editors=001)** _(@ [CodePen](http://codepen.io/developit/pen/ZbajXQ?editors=001) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/developit/g5qnLnue/))_
